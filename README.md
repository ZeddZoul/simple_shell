# C - BUILD YOUR OWN SHELL
## Introduction: :ledger:
* One of the core tenets of the ALX SE program is the belief in doing hard things and now, they have presented us with another hard thing
* The mission of this current task is to build a shell that will work as good as any bash shell or even better
* As usual, there are restraints and constraints on the number and type of functions we're allowed to use but the fact that we're working in teams of two means that we have more info and resources to use

## Helper Files: :raised_hands:
Every file is a helper file though as ALX didn't provide us with the usual _putchar function

## Header Files: :scroll:
* [shell.h](./shell.h)
It contains all the header files we should have been constantly declaring to usse functions and syscalls like the write and read_

* [header](./headers/) :file_folder:
 <details>
  <summary>It contains other header files that were used in declaring related function prototypes</summary>

  * [builtin.h](./headers/builtin.h) :scroll: </br>
    Contains the header prototypes for the builtins
  * [include.h](./headers/include.h) :scroll: </br>
    Contains the struct for the node type and the C header files
  * [path.h](./headers/path.h) :scroll: </br>
    Contains the prototpyes for the functions that find the environmental path
  * [string.h](./headers/string.h) :scroll: </br>
    Contains prototypes for the string functions
</details>

  <summary>Please click this arrow for compilation instructions</summary>

  * Use **_gcc *.c -o hsh_** to compile
  * THen run **./hsh**
  * Ignore any .swo, .swp and any other file that is not an executable, C or header file
  * This shell has been tested and trusted. It comes with some builtins though
